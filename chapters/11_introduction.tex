\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

% This is the introduction where you should introduce your work. In
% general the thing to aim for here is to describe a little bit of the
% context for your work -- why did you do it (motivation), what was the
% hoped-for outcome (aims) -- as well as trying to give a brief overview
% of what you actually did.
%
% It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into this
% chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or a particularly
% interesting finding).
%
% It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the document,
% although without care this can appear formulaic and tedious. Your
% call.
