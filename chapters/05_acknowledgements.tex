\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This project would not have been possible without the wonderful support of my co-supervisor Sasha Lopoukhine, whose insight and advice has been indispensable, and my supervisor Dr Tobias Grosser, whose project ideas and guidance throughout the project have been invaluable.
I'd also like to thank the rest of the Grosser Lab, in particular Mathieu for his xDSL and MLIR expertise, along with Ivan, Emma, and L\'eo for their insights and friendship in the office.
Finally, I'd like to thank my parents, Jonathan and Victoria, for their perpetual support and well-reasoned advice, especially in times when life is difficult.
