\subsection{Operation trait checks}

% Hook
Having specialised xDSL's \mintinline{python}{has_trait} method to the most minimal implementation which expresses the desired functionality, we can draw comparisons between equivalent algorithms which predominantly measure the effect of the language runtime.
% Argument
Both implementations (Listing \ref{listing:ubenchmark-trait-checks-both}) share the same underlying algorithm: iteration over an operations traits, checking against each one. However, the mechanism used for this algorithm differs significantly between xDSL and MLIR.
By leveraging Python's dynamic nature, xDSL can invoke the \mintinline{python}{isinstance} function to check each trait. In contrast, MLIR uses template metaprogramming instead of the class hierarchy to define traits. This depends on \mintinline{c++}{TypeID}\footnote{\url{https://mlir.llvm.org/doxygen/TypeID_8h_source.html}}, a custom data structure to encode dynamic \ac{rtti} in C++.
% TODO: Does this need more detail?
Whilst this implementation incurs complexity (\autoref{fig:ubenchmark-hastrait-dynamism}), it remains performant, as the \mintinline{c++}{TypeID} data structure is constructed to remedy many of the issues of native C++ \ac{rtti}.
% Link
However, this dynamism impacts performance beyond just the runtime of the individual function, as it presents an optimisation boundary -- precluding other optimisations which could be applied if the result could be inferred at compile time. % TODO: This really needs to be substantiated somehow, but perhaps not here?
