\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}

% A more extensive coverage of what's required to understand your work.
% In general you should assume the reader has a good undergraduate
% degree in computer science, but is not necessarily an expert in the
% particular area you've been working on. Hence this chapter may need to
% summarize some ``text book'' material.
%
% This is not something you'd normally require in an academic paper, and
% it may not be appropriate for your particular circumstances. Indeed,
% in some cases it's possible to cover all of the ``background''
% material either in the introduction or at appropriate places in the
% rest of the dissertation.

%% The state of modern compiler development/usage

% A brief overview of how Python works, talking about bytecode and stuff


\section{Python performance}
\label{sec:python-performance}

% \subsection{Python performance measurement}
% \label{ssec:python-perf-measurement}
% % timeit/asv/pyperf and stuff maybe? Possibly not worth discussing, or could be related work?

% \subsection{Python performance matters}
% \label{ssec:python-performance-matters}

% % Typically, we want to bind into C as much as possible -- see things like Scalene to measure this. However, for our pattern rewriting workload, this is less suitable
